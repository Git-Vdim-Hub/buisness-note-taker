# buisness-note-taker
## Description
- This application keeps track of notes and thoughts for a buisness! The app runs on heroku with a fully developed front end and back end.  
- I built this to enable a buisness to stay organized.
- One of the biggest lessons learned during this project was the use of expressjs for back-end architecture.
- During this project I got to work with the express npm dependency including get, post and delete methodology get a better grasp on the nodejs file system methods such as fs.writeFile(), fs.readFile() and fs.appendFile(), work with Heroku to deploy a webpage, get a deeper understanding of package.json and work with a back end + front end file structure system.
